# Data_Structure_Checkpiont
Files uploaded are algorithms for the data structure / procedural progamming structure.
sum.algo and dot_product.algo
sum.algo provides a solution to the first problem in the checkpoint.
dot_product.algo provides a solution to the second problem in the checkpoint.
simple comment are embedded to in the algorithm to convey the essence of particular lines of the algorithm.
