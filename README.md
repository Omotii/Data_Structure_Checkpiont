# Data_Structure_Checkpiont
Files uploaded are algorithms for the data structure / procedural progamming structure.

sum.algo and dot_product.algo

sum.algo provides a solution to the first problem in the checkpoint.

dot_product.algo provides a solution to the second problem in the checkpoint.

simple comment are embedded to in the algorithm to convey the essence of particular lines of the algorithm.
